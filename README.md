Suddenly, You see a soldier Running towards the Lord, as The Lord sees him, his facial expression changes, Soldier who was sent to search for the army, the lord worried, as he suddenly stands up, The Soldier bows for the lord, as the lord asks "Soldier!, Why are you in such a rush?, what happend!"
The Soldier, takes a deep breath, as his words are barely heard, The Lord asks "Soldier, Take you breath, respond to me, WHAT HAPPEND?"
The Soldier finally speaks a clear sentence, almost quietly, as he breathes heavily, "YOUR MAJESTY.... Th-,The ARMY!"
The lord worried, shouts at the soldier, "WHAT HAPPEND TO MY ARMY SOLDIER."
The Soldier replies: "THEY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED,I'VE ESCAPED FROM THE BATTLEFIELD, THEY W-WERE AMBUSHED BY GOBLINS!
The Lord's face turns red, his expression was filled with anger, with a loud voice, The Lord calling his right hand.
The Commander apporaches the scene, as he was curious and confused about what's happening.
The Lord says: "Commander, Our army is in danger, Those goblins have went in our way again, Those scums, I want to do a meeting with the WHOLE LEADERSHIP, RIGHT FUCKING NOW!"
The Commander bows then sends his companions to spread the message to all leadership.
Exactly 30 Minutes later, All the leaders were gathering.
The Lord enter the rooms, as they all stand up, bowing to the lord.
....The Silence fills the room, as The Lord looks like he's in complete anger and crossed.
A leader.., Sounds worried, He was the leader of the loyal knights, his name was Calvin.
He asks the Lord, "I never seen you in such anger Your majesty."
The Lord looks at Calvin, as he takes a deep, breath, exhales, letting out the air
"Our army, Has been attacked, by goblins, Again.." says the Lord
Calvin Shakes his head, says "What's your plan, Your majesty?"
The Lord says: "We need to send the knights there, Calvin, My army should be save from anything, AND THEY SHOULD BE SAVED FROM GOBLINS, I DON'T WANT MY ARMY TO BE HOSTAGES TO THOSE SCUMBAGS!"
Calvin says "Lord Mark...I have an idea." You finally hear The Lord's name that's rarly mentioned upon the leaders. as he was always dressed as "His majesty"
Lord Mark asks "You're the most intelligent here, Calvin, Give me your best ideas."
Calvin cracks a smile, as he proudly says, "My Lord, Why worry?, We can do a trap!, My knights were always addressed as "The Tricky swords.", We'll move 2 powerful well-known knights, heavily armed to search to the army, attracting  the goblins to attack. 
Then when the right time comes, My knights will rush all of them, taking them one by one, Then we'll search for our army in their caves"
Lord Mark proudly says: You have the plan, I have to order you to go there, you have my blessing."
You hear the voices of horses hustling, running. in the middle of the village
The People gathers, greeting the Loyal knights.
Calvin and his knights rushing, and they let out 2 Knights move, as the others hide.
Goblins rush them, as Calvin gives the signal saying. "ATTACK!" as the battlefield rises, the goblins were defeated.

They enter the cave
